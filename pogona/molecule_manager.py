    If True, adding or deleting a molecule will happen immediately
    when `add_molecule` or `destroy_molecule` is called.

    However, since such calls usually happen while the collection
    of molecules is being iterated over, and because changing a collection
    while iterating over it may cause problems, we can alternatively
    collect all molecules to add and all molecules to delete in
    temporary lists.
    Since we can assume these temporary lists to be much smaller than
    the total number of molecules in each time step, which would have
    to be copied otherwise in each step, this should give us a
    performance benefit.

    If False, make sure to call `apply_changes` at the end of each
    time step.
