Visual Debugging
================

Not all potential issues in a simulation scenario can be caught in the simulation itself.
A first approach for visual debugging is already presented in the chapter on :ref:`Running a Simulation <running>`, namely inspecting the movement of particles through the scene using Blender.
We will expand on this approach below.

Please note: Some steps are only supported with Blender versions 3.0.0 or higher and with the Cycles render engine enabled.

Points to Spheres with Geometry Nodes
-------------------------------------

If you have tried to render the animation of the previous chapter, you may have noticed that the particles are invisible.
This is because, for now, each particle is only a vertex in a mesh without any surfaces.
Blender supports a couple of ways to make these vertices visible, but the most flexible option is to instance a copy of some reference object, like a sphere, at each of the points using Geometry Nodes.

First, create an object to represent each of your particles (for example, an Ico Sphere).
Optionally, hide this object in the Outliner window both for the viewport and for renders â€“ otherwise, it may later be confusing to always have one stationary particle in the scene.

Next, open a Geometry Workspace (click on the '+' in the tab bar at the very top).
In the middle of the workspace, click "New" to add a new Geometry Node graph.
To instantiate your particle object at each of the visualization's particle positions, add a new Point Instance node, connect it to the Group Input and Output, and provide your particle object accordingly.
Depending on the size of your original particle object, your particles may be too large or too small.
Scale your particle object in edit mode to an appropriate size or add a Point Scale node before(!) the Point Instance node.

Importing Particle Attributes
-----------------------------

With your Pogona Molecules Visualization instance selected, look again at the Pogona Molecules Visualization properties in the Object Properties panel.
Below the Time Step field, you should see an empty list and a button for adding a new attribute.
You can import any of the columns in you particle positions CSVs as attributes.
In this example, we will use the ``object_id`` to visualize which Pogona Object a particle "thinks" it belongs to.
Click the "Add" button, enter ``object_id`` as the attribute name to import, and choose the type ``Integer``.

Note: If you want to import a vector, you must either import each column separately or ensure that the 3 columns are named in the format ``"<variable name>_<axis>"`` (for example, ``"velocity_x"``).
String-valued attributes are as of now unsupported by Blender's Geometry Nodes.
As a workaround, you can select "Hashed String" to generate a unique integer for every different string.

Playing back the animation in the example scenario, you should now see a new column ``object_id`` in the spreadsheet window and its values changing as particles move from one tube to the next.
You can already use this attribute to give each particle a different size depending on the ``object_id``, for example.
However, we want to use color to convey this information.

Visualizing Particle Attributes with Color
------------------------------------------

Before we can use the ``object_id`` in a shader to control the color of each particle, we must first 'transfer' the attribute.
This is because originally, the attribute is only assigned to the individual vertices at the original particle positions, but not automatically adopted to each instance when using the Point Instance node.
To solve this, add an Attribute Transfer node, connect it after the Point Instance node, set its Source Geometry to any of the outputs from before the Point Instance node, set its Source attribute to ``object_id``, give the destination attribute a recognizable name (we'll use ``object_id`` here as well), and, for now, select the Domain "Point" and Mapping "Nearest".

At this point, we are able to use the ``object_id`` in a shader, so switch to a Shading workspace.
Begin by adding some lights and giving the tubes in the example scenario some transparent materials so we can see the particles inside them.

.. figure:: ../img/getting-started_vis-debug_blender_lights-and-materials.png

    Blender Screenshot: Tubes shown at their interconnection point with transparent Principled BSDF materials.
    There is not material applied to the particles themselves yet.

Finally, select your single particle (not the Pogona Molecules Visualization with the instanced praticles) and give it a new material.
Add a new Attribute node, set its Type to Geometry and its Name to ``object_id``.
As a precaution for at some point having more than 2 objects, add a MapRange node and change its From Max value to the number of possible objects minus 1.
Then connect its input to the Attribute's Fac output (since ``object_id`` is 1-dimensional) and route its output through a ColorRamp into the Base Color input of the Principled BSDF node (and optionally into the Emission input).
